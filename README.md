# 🥷⚔️ CodeRonin: SRE Edition  
### *The only coding platform that fights back.*

---

## The Problem

Most coding platforms teach the **“Happy Path.”**  
Production doesn’t.

In real systems (UPI-scale traffic, e-commerce microservices), engineers spend **80% of their time debugging**, tracing logs, and stopping cascading failures.  

New developers aren’t trained for this — leading to **Production Panic**.

---

## The Solution

**CodeRonin is a Debug Dojo.**

An adversarial AI Saboteur injects realistic, stealthy bugs into a browser-based microservices simulation.

You act as the **SRE**:

- Inspect logs  
- Trace failures  
- Find the root cause  
- Fix the system  

All while the **Chaos Meter** rises.

---

## What Makes It Different

- **Adversarial Pedagogy** – The AI breaks your system on purpose.  
- **WASM-Powered Arena** – Runs entirely in-browser (zero setup).  
- **Real Observability** – Unified logs, service maps, trace views.  

---

## The Goal

Train engineers for the **70% of the job that no platform teaches**:

Keeping systems alive under fire.

> Debug under pressure.  
> Survive the chaos.  
> Become CodeRonin.
